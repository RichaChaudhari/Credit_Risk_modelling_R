# Credit Risk Modeling: Predicting Loan Defaults

# Project Overview
This project develops a machine learning model to predict whether a borrower will default on a loan within two years. Using the "Give Me Some Credit" dataset from Kaggle, I compare multiple classification models to address severe class imbalance and optimize the trade-off between recall (identifying defaulters) and precision (minimizing false positives).

Key Features:
- Handles extreme class imbalance (6.8% default rate)
- Compares 5 models: Weighted Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Balanced RF, XGBoost, and LightGBM
- Extensive feature engineering and missing value analysis
- Threshold optimization for operational decision-making

#Research Question
"To what extent do data balancing techniques, including class weighting and sampling methods, improve the performance of logistic regression, random forest, LightGBM, and XGBoost models in predicting credit default within imbalanced financial datasets, and which approach optimally balances recall against precision?"
